(Damn) Maybe I can find some peace of mind But the older I get the harder it's to find When I grow up, I won't have to worry if I'm good enough I won't have to think about myself too much And I can have a drink if I wanna get drunk When I grow up, when I grow up Can't wait for the day, that I feel okay I just wanna be like the kid I was, when I grow up All my friends are getting married I can't afford a ring, let alone these fuckin' weddings Plus I can't find a girl to marry They say I got time, but like, time is fuckin' scary man They always be comparing me to him and her When that just isn't fair to me You know I'm not a kid so why you kiddin' me? You say my bad habits are annoyin' But I don't play with toys, so why you toyin? Maybe I can find some peace of mind But the older I get the harder it's to find When I grow up, I won't have to worry if I'm good enough I won't have to think about myself too much And I can have a drink if I wanna get drunk When I grow up, when I grow up Can't wait for the day, that I feel okay I just wanna be like the kid I was, when I grow up Will someone explain, why things didn't change? I thought I would've had it all figured out by now
I wish I was ambitious, but that's not what you're supposed to do 'Cause there is no one in the world who can't stop me from thinking about it All my life has been a waste of time (Oh-huh) And so many years have gone by We've come together and we'll never see each other again How long will this last? So much more than just
Whispered something in your ear It was a perverted thing to say But I said it anyway Made you smile and look away Nothing's gonna hurt you baby As long as you're with me you'll be just fine Nothing's gonna hurt you baby Nothing's gonna take you from my side When we dance in my living room To that silly 90's R&B When we have a drink or three Always ends in a hazy shower scene Nothing's gonna hurt you baby As long as you're with me you'll be just fine Nothing's gonna hurt you baby Nothing's gonna take you from my side When we laugh into the microphone and singing With our sunglasses on to our favorite songs When we're laughing in the microphone and singing With our sunglasses on to our favorite songs Nothing's gonna hurt you baby Nothing's gonna take you from my side
Whispered something in your ear I don't know what you're talking about But it's just a matter of time You've been waiting for me to say 'Oh, oh-oh' And this is the only thing that we can do right now We'll never be alone with each other (I'm not gonna let go) Whispers are coming from all over my head It feels like

Step out into the dawn and you'll never know what it's like to be a part of your life You're in love with me And I can't help but wonder Why are we so different from each other? We've been living together for more thanhundred years, our lives have changed forever The only thing that will change is how much time has gone on my mind Every single day
NA You're the light, you're the night You're the colour of my blood You're the cure, you're the pain You're the only thing I wanna touch Never knew that it could mean so much, so much You're the fear, I don't care Cause I've never been so high Follow me through the dark Let me take you past the satellites You can see the world you brought to life, to life So love me like you do, la-la-love me like you do Love me like you do, la-la-love me like you do Touch me like you do, ta-ta-touch me like you do What are you waiting for? Fading in, fading out On the edge of paradise Every inch of your skin is a Holy Grail I've got to find Only you can set my heart on fire, on fire Yeah I'll let you set the pace Cause I'm not thinking straight My head's spinning around, I can't see clear no more What are you waiting for? Love me like you do, la-la-love me like you do Love me like you do, la-la-love me like you do Touch me like you do, ta-ta-touch me like you do What are you waiting for?

You're like a demon on my back You cage me You bring me down You plague me I bet you swore I'd take you back You're crazy You bring me down You caged me Once upon a time I thought you were irresistible You were mystical and magical to me Now I don't quite believe you are so radical So I'm leaving you to be free CHORUS: Well, what did you expect? You caged me in your home Like I was something you owned Well, what did you expect? You caged me in your home You called it freedom Your love is what my nightmares are made of You laid your cards on the table Took mine away You said I wasn't able to give you love CHORUS: Well, what did you expect? You caged me in your home You called it freedom You called it love Your obsession with control Pains me It wore me down It changed me And I thought that getting out would kill me But it's been such a bitter relief A bitter sweet release You can't be my medicine Come on Check out the evidence I'm no good for you And you're no good for me You mistake your arrogance for intelligence So I'm leaving you to be free CHORUS: Well, what did you expect? You caged me in your home Like I was something you owned Well, what did you expect? You caged me in your home You called it freedom Your love is what my nightmares are made of You laid your cards on the table Took mine away You said I wasn't able to give you love CHORUS: Well, what did you expect? You caged me in your home You called it freedom You called it love You caged me in your home like I was something you owned Well, what did you expect? You caged me in your home You called it freedom You called it love
You're like a demon on my mind, but I don't know what to say You've got me in the back of your head And that's all you can do right now Is it alright?
Feel the ocean as it breathes Shivering teeth See the mountains where they meet Smothering me As the wind fends off the waves I count down the days Heavy stones Fear no weather I find comfort in the sound And the shape of the heart How it echoes through the chest From under the ground As the hills turn into holes I fill them with gold Heavy stones Fear no weather And from the rain Comes a river running wild that will create And empire for you, illuminate There's a river running wild that will create An empire for you An empire for two An empire for you An empire for two And I paint your body black I hide in your hair And you're staring back at me Like I wasn't there As our bodies become stills We welcome the fear Heavy stones Fear no weather And from the rain Comes a river running wild that will create And empire for you, illuminate There's a river running wild that will create An empire for you An empire for two An empire for you An empire for two NA And from the rain Comes a river running wild that will create And empire for you, illuminate There's a river running wild that will create An empire for you An empire for two An empire for you An empire for two
Feel the ocean as it did when you were young And I don't know what's going on in your mind You're like, "I'm not gonna be around for a while"
We were searching for an easy way to say to you But the writings on the wall Oh, we've come to see what you say of what you are But you leave us wanting more (Uma) Why are you hiding? (Uma) The world isn't crying (Uma) Oh, I wish I didn't love you but I do (Uma) Better watch what you say (Uma) When you talk in that way (Uma) I wish I didn't love you, but I do Pass the public school in an early evening pick-up run West Astoria Boulevard Uma says it's funny how memories, fade like setting suns Quietly shaping who we are, are are are (Uma) Why are you hiding? (Uma) The world isn't crying (Uma) Oh, I wish I didn't love you but I do (Uma) Better watch what you say (Uma) When you talk in that way (Uma) I wish I didn't love you, but I do We were hoping for a better way to explain to you But we'd be lying after all, all There's a Cadillac parked on 32nd Avenue Shining headlights on your door (Uma) Why are you hiding? (Uma) The world isn't crying (Uma) Oh, I wish I didn't love you but I do (Uma) Better watch what you say (Uma) When you talk in that way (Uma) I wish I didn't love you, but I do
We were searching for an answer, but I couldn't find a way to get it out of my head We had no idea what was going on in the first place But now we know that there's more than just one thing You can do when you're with me (I'm not gonna lie)
She just wants to be beautiful She goes unnoticed, she knows no limits She craves attention, she praises an image She prays to be sculpted by the sculptor Oh, she don't see the light that's shining Deeper than the eyes can find it Maybe we have made her blind So she tries to cover up her pain and cut her woes away Cause covergirls don't cry after their face is made But there's a hope that's waiting for you in the dark You should know you're beautiful just the way you are And you don't have to change a thing The world could change its heart No scars to your beautiful, we're stars and we're beautiful Oh, oh, oh Oh-oh, oh, oh And you don't have to change a thing The world could change its heart No scars to your beautiful, we're stars and we're beautiful She has dreams to be an envy, so she's starving You know, covergirls eat nothing She says "beauty is pain and there's beauty in everything" "What's a little bit of hunger?" "I can go a little while longer," she fades away She don't see her perfect, she don't understand she's worth it Or that beauty goes deeper than the surface, oh, oh So to all the girls that's hurting, let me be your mirror Help you see a little bit clearer the light that shines within There's a hope that's waiting for you in the dark You should know you're beautiful just the way you are And you don't have to change a thing The world could change its heart No scars to your beautiful, we're stars and we're beautiful No better you than the you that you are No better you than the you that you are No better life than the life we're living No better life than the life we're living No better time for your shine, you're a star No better time for your shine, you're a star Oh, you're beautiful, oh, you're beautiful And there's a hope that's waiting for you in the dark You should know you're beautiful just the way you are And you don't have to change a thing The world could change its heart No scars to your beautiful, we're stars and we're beautiful And you don't have to change a thing The world could change its heart No scars to your beautiful, we're stars and we're beautiful
She just wants to be with me I don't know what it's like when you're in the middle of my life She said, "I'm not gonna let her go" (Oh-huh) 'Cause she knows that we'll never get back together We've been talking about this for a long time But no one will ever stop us from loving each other So keep your eyes on

To your soul To your soul Cry Cry Cry You leave in the morning with everything you own in a little black case Alone on a platform, the wind and the rain on a sad and lonely face Mother will never understand why you had to leave But the answers you seek will never be found at home The love that you need will never be found at home Run away, turn away, run away, turn away, run away Run away, turn away, run away, turn away, run away Pushed around and kicked around, always a lonely boy You were the one that they'd talk about around town as they put you down And as hard as they would try they'd hurt to make you cry But you never cried to them, just to your soul No, you never cried to them, just to your soul Run away, turn away, run away, turn away, run away (Crying to your soul) Run away, turn away, run away, turn away, run away (Crying to your soul) Run away, turn away, run away, turn away, run away (Crying to your soul) Run away, turn away, run away, turn away, run away Cry, boy, cry Cry, boy, cry Cry, boy, cry, boy, cry Cry, boy, cry, boy, cry Cry, boy, cry, boy, cry Cry, boy, cry, boy, cry Cry, boy, cry, boy, cry Cry, boy, cry, boy, cry You leave in the morning with everything you own in a little black case Alone on a platform, the wind and the rain on a sad and lonely face Run away, turn away, run away, turn away, run away Run away, turn away, run away, turn away, run away Run away, turn away, run away, turn away, run away Run away, turn away, run away, turn away, run away Run away, turn away, run away, turn away, run away Run away, turn away, run away, turn away, run away
To your soul To your heart to make me feel like I'm in love with you (I don't know what that means) It's just a matter of time You're not gonna let it go, but we'll be there for the long
I've been staring at the edge of the water Long as I can remember, never really knowing why I wish I could be the perfect daughter But I come back to the water, no matter how hard I try Every turn I take, every trail I track Every path I make, every road leads back To the place I know, where I cannot go Where I long to be See the line where the sky meets the sea? It calls me And no one knows how far it goes If the wind in my sail on the sea stays behind me One day I'll know, if I go there's just no telling how far I'll go Go-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh Go-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh Go-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh Go-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh I know everybody on this island seems so happy On this island, everything is by design I know everybody on this island has a role on this island So maybe I can roll with mine I can lead with pride, I can make us strong I'll be satisfied if I play along But the voice inside sings a different song What is wrong with me? See the light as it shines on the sea? It's blinding But no one knows, how deep it goes And it seems like it's calling out to me, so come find me And let me know, what's beyond that line, will I cross that line? See the line where the sky meets the sea? It calls me And no one knows, how far it goes If the wind in my sail on the sea stays behind me One day I'll know, how far I'll go
I've been staring at the world for a while, but I don't know what it's like to be on my own when you're in love with someone else You'll never see me again The only thing that we can do is make us feel so good about each other So much more than just loving one another 'Cause all of our friends are falling apart (Oh-ooh) And
