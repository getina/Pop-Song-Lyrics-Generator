And tell me you can stay 'Cause I'm thinking maybe For you, I would travel to outer space Take a bullet to the heart just to keep you safe For you, anything for you With you, all the years just fade away Like a dream in my arms, but I'm wide awake With you, whenever I'm with you Ain't it funny how the time flies?
